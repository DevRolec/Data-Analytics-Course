Analysis VS Analytics
To analyze is to EXAMINE, looking at information or details within the said data set.
Analytics means using a defined system, tools and techniques 

 # The 7 Key Phases of the analytics lifecycle
 1. Define the problem
 2. Data Collection
 3. Data Preparation
 4. Data Exploration
 5. Modelling & Analysis
 6. Deployment
 7. Monitoring & Optimization
    ## Defining Problems
GOAL: Frame a clear, specific and measurable business question
Steps involved: 
1. Meet with the stakeholders
2. Define KPI( Key Performance Indicators)
3. Understand the business context
   

    ## Data Collection
   GOAL: Gather the right set of data that answers the question
   Internal: CRM, ERP, Website logs, databases
   (CRM: Customer Relationship Management)
   A CRM system is one that helps a business manage interactions with customers and track sale, marketing and support activities.
   .Store Customer Information
   .Manages sales pipelines and leads
   .Track customer support tickets
   .Automate email marketing
   .Analyze customer behavior
   ## Tools:
   * Salesforce
   * Hubspot
   * Zoho
   * MS Dynamics 365
   * Pipedive

     ## (ERP= Enterprise Resource Planning)
     Integrates all the business processes (Like finance, supply chain, HR, inventory, Manufacturing etc) into one platform
     Provide Accounting and financial records
     Inventory and order management
     Data about HR
     Procurement and Supply chain
     Manufacturing and Logistics
  
        External: APIs, Survey, Market reports

   Tools: SQL, Python, ETL tools, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Segment.
   GOAL: Create a relevant, accurate, timely, and accessible data.
     
     ## Data Preparation
     Goal: Clean and format the data for a smooth analysis
     Tasks: Generate and handle missing values
     Remove duplicates
     Convert formats (eg dates, currencies etc)
     Normalize or encode the data

     TOOLS:
     Python (Pandas, NumPy)
     Excel, Power Query

     Data Exploration (EDA)
   Goal:Uncover patterns, trends and anomalies
   TEchniques:
   Summary statistics (Mean Median and Mode)
   Correlation Matrices
   Data Visualization (Histograms, Scatter plots, box plots)

   Tools:
   Python (Mathplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
   Tableau, Power BI

   ## Modeling and Analysis
   Build statistical or machine learning models to derive insights or predictions
   Types of Analysis
   1. Descriptive: What happened?
   2. Diagnostic: Why did it happen?
   3. Predictive: What might happen?
   4. Prescriptive: What should we do?
      Tools:
      Python
      SQL
      Excel
   ## Deployment
   Goal: Put the analysis and model into action
   EX:
Embed dashboards into business workflows
Deploy ML Models to production (..APIs)
Send automated alerts or reports

Tools:
Tableau, Power BI(Dashboards)
FastAPI
git, Azure/AWS (for scaling)

## Monitoring & Optimization
